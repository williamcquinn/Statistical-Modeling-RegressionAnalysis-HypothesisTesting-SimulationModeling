The hot hand phenomenon refers to the expectation of “streaks” in sequences of hits and misses whose probabilities are, in fact, independent. This repository includes experimental design, featuring regression analysis through linear modeling, hypotheses testing with both a conditional probability and streaks approach, as well as simulation modeling to answer the questions of the hot hand phenomenon.
